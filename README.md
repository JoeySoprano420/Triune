# Triune

| Cognitive Tier | Language Core Equivalent                    |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Why**        | Logic, conditions, definitions, proof       |
| **How**        | Pattern, matching, polymorphism, analogy    |
| **What**       | Execution steps, instructions, flow control |

| Concept                | Syntax Example                             |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Variable Declaration   | `let age := 21`                            |
| Conditional Logic      | `if age > 18 then say "Adult"`             |
| Pattern Matching       | `match weather: when sunny => wear("hat")` |
| Function Definition    | `func greet(who): say "Hello, {who}"`      |
| Logical Truth Types    | `truth x := (a == a)`                      |
| Proof by Contradiction | `if not(x == x): error "Logic failure"`    |

ðŸ“š Teaching Model Integration
Triune includes syntax modes for each learner style:

@why_mode â†’ triggers Socratic-style prompts, explanations.

@how_mode â†’ triggers visual metaphors and execution traces.

@what_mode â†’ collapses to pure instruction list for linear learners.
